# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex Denisov, C# and unity game developer based in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
I have 9+ years of commercial development experience, including more than 2 years specializing in game development.

I chose game development not only for the joy of creating fun, immersive experiences, but also for the deep challenge of combining technology, psychology, and storytelling. Iâ€™m driven by the intersection of creativity and logic, and I find inspiration in turning complex ideas into polished, player-focused products.

Iâ€™m quick to grasp new concepts and have a knack for solving complex challenges, ensuring your project stays on track. My strong communication skills and ability to translate business needs into technical solutions mean you'll always know what to expect.

Hereâ€™s what I can do for you:  
ðŸ”¹ Full-Cycle Game Development: From concept to release, I'll guide your project through every stage.  
ðŸ”¹ Bug Fixing and Optimization: I ensure your game runs smoothly across all platforms.  
ðŸ”¹ Cross-Platform Expertise: Whether it's Android, iOS, WebGL, or PC, I make sure your game shines everywhere.  
ðŸ”¹ Clear Communication: I keep you updated, so there are no surprisesâ€”just great results.
